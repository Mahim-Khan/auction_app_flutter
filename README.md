# auction_app_flutter

Hi this is mahim khan.
In step 1 it was easy for me because i have build an application with firebase auth user.
In setp 3-5 i don't have any idea of auction app, i have build add task/Todo app similer like that. I have tried the best i can but failed. The Next commit part(Step 3-5) i am not shearing. If you want know how i have tried i can shear it later. 
Lastly i want to say i have learn flutter from youtube docs without proper course but still i have build an application called LearnLing. If i get help i will build any application with any database(firbase,aws) or any satemanagment(Getx,Bloc).
